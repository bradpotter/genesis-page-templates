# Genesis Page Templates

Genesis Page Templates is a plugin created for the Genesis Framework which adds additional page templates to the Genesis Framework.

## Description

Genesis Page Templates takes advantage of a [new filter](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/34995/) introduced in WordPress 4.4.0. The first page template introduced in Genesis Page Templates is a custom loop page template which allows a user to conveniently modify the loop from the page editor by entering settings in a meta box.


## Custom Loop Settings

* Post Type (Enter post, page or custom post type) 

* Taxonomy (Enter taxonomy, example: category, post_tag, etc.)

* Taxonomy Term (Enter taxonomy term, example: featured, blog, etc. )

* Post Per Page (Enter number of posts to display)

* Order By (Enter author, title, name, type, date, rand, etc.)

* Order (Enter ASC or DESC)


## Requirements

* Genesis Framework 2.0.0 or later
* WordPress 4.4.0

`git clone git@github.com:bradpotter/genesis-page-templates.git`

Then go to your Plugins screen and click __Activate__.

## Usage

Activate the plugin. A new meta box titled "Custom Loop Settings" will be added to the Edit Page screen. Select the "Custom Loop" template from Page Attributes drop down menu with the Edit Page screen. Enter parameters in the Custom Loop Settings meta box to modify the custom loop. 

Note: Since this is the initial release of the plugin I discourage using it on a production website until it has been thoroughly tested.

## Future Development

Introduce additional page templates. Update post type, taxonomy and taxonomy terms to accept multiple parameters. Add additional setting options.
